## Hello, welcome to ChrisplayzWii and RM05's 2006- aug 6th 07 Wii Shop Channel recreation!
<p>(its 2006-aug8th2007 because that was when nintendo changed the design of the welcome screen and added wiiware.)</p>
<br>
<h2>This project is a recreation of the Wii Shop from the Wii's release date to august 6th, 2007, this recreation allows those whom didn't get to experience the shop back then, or just to get back nostalgia for the people who used it during that time!
  This recreation is made by ChrisplayzWii and RM05!</h2>
